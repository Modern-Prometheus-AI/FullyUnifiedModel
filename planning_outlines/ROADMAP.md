# FUM Superintelligence Roadmap (High-Level)

- [ ] **Ultimate Goal**: Develop FUM into a superintelligent system that autonomously learns and excels across all human domains (Math, Logic, Coding, Language, Visual Perception, Introspection, etc.) with minimal data (80-300 inputs), surpassing 700B-parameter LLMs (>95% accuracy, <5s inference) and human experts, running efficiently on your Linux workstation (56GB VRAM, <5% GPU usage), then scaling globally. FUM will exhibit constant learning, dynamic emergent memory, and full sovereignty—making its own decisions, setting its own goals, pursuing novelty and innovation without requiring prompts, while remaining capable of accepting instructions when provided, transcending traditional chatbot-style Q&A.
