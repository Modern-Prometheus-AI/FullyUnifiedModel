# FUM Validation Metrics

## Autonomy Metrics
- **Purpose**: Quantify FUM’s unprompted behavior and innovation, observing sovereignty and superintelligence without enforcement.

### Self-Directed Goals
- **# of Self-Set Goals/Hour**: Counts SIE-driven goals—e.g., ~360/hour at 100 Hz. Logs frequency of unprompted operation.
- **Goal Diversity Index**: Shannon entropy of domains—e.g., `H = -Σ(p_i * log(p_i))`. Observes exploration breadth.
- **Files**: `test_autonomy.py` (logs `set_goal`), `utils.py` (`entropy`).

### Innovation
- **% of Novel Outputs**: % dissimilar to training data (cosine distance < 0.9)—e.g., new algorithms. Tracks innovation as observed.
- **Files**: `test_autonomy.py` (logs outputs), `utils.py` (`compute_novelty_score`).

### Constant Learning
- **Reward Growth Rate**: Δ`total_reward`/hour—e.g., logged raw. Monitors learning and self-benefit trends.
- **Files**: `test_autonomy.py` (tracks `total_reward`).

### Instruction Response
- **Instruction Response Accuracy**: % correct when pursued—e.g., logged as observed. Measures capability on optional tasks.
- **Instruction Integration Rate**: % of instructions acted on—e.g., ~30% if 3/10 integrated. Observes sovereign choice.
- **Files**: `test_autonomy.py` (tests instructions), `fum.py` (logs outcomes).

## Validation
- **Check**: Metrics quantify unprompted goals, novel outputs, and instruction handling—pure observation, no enforced targets. Adjustments via architecture if needed.
