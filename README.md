# Fully Unified Model (FUM)

The Fully Unified Model (FUM) is a brain-inspired artificial intelligence architecture that combines spiking neural networks with reinforcement learning to achieve efficient learning from minimal data.

## Key Features

- **Brain-inspired architecture**: Uses spiking neurons with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and structural plasticity
- **Efficient learning**: Designed to achieve expert-level performance from minimal training data (target: 80-300 inputs)
- **Self-organizing**: Emergent knowledge graph forms through learning without predefined layers
- **Multimodal processing**: Handles diverse input types through universal spike-based encoding
- **Continuous adaptation**: Self-modification capabilities enable long-term autonomous learning

## Repository Contents

- `Fully_Unified_Model.pdf`: Technical paper detailing the architecture and theoretical foundations
- `How_It_Works/`: Comprehensive implementation documentation covering:
  - Core architecture components
  - Multimodal I/O processing
  - Emergent behaviors and self-organization
  - Training and scaling strategy
  - Practical implementation considerations

## Development Approach

FUM follows a phased development roadmap:

1. **Foundation Building**: Initial network formation with minimal data
2. **Competence Refinement**: Strengthening domain-specific pathways
3. **Autonomous Mastery**: Continuous self-learning and scaling

The model is designed to scale efficiently from small prototypes to large-scale deployment while maintaining stability and performance.
