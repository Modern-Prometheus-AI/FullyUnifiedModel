# Autonomous Mathematical Innovation Protocol Output: TDA for FUM KG Analysis (V2)

**Date:** 2025-04-01
**Agent:** MathAgent
**Protocol:** `design/Novelty/math_tool_design/autonomous_math_protocol.md` (Executed with strict termination conditions)
**Initial Goal:** Select Area 2 (KG Quantification) from `design/Novelty/search.md` and pursue development and validation of a novel mathematical framework addressing its core challenge according to the full autonomous protocol.

## 1. FUM Problem Context

*   **Selected Area:** `design/Novelty/search.md` - Section 2: Emergent Knowledge Graph (KG): Quantifying Structure, Dynamics, and Computation via Advanced Mathematics.
*   **FUM Gap:** Existing FUM metrics (`efficiency_score`, `pathology_score`, `graph_entropy`) primarily capture activity, diversity, or basic degree distributions. There is a lack of formal methods to characterize the KG's multi-scale topological organization (connectivity, cycles, voids), hindering a deeper understanding of how KG structure relates to function.
*   **Refined Goal:** Develop and empirically validate novel Topological Data Analysis (TDA) metrics (using persistent homology) to quantify KG structure. Validate by demonstrating statistically significant correlations (|Pearson r| > 0.6, p < 0.05) between TDA metrics and FUM's `efficiency_score` and `pathology_score` across simulation stages (tested conceptually at 1M neuron scale). Assess computational feasibility.
*   **Relevant FUM Documentation:** `How_It_Works/2D_Unified_Knowledge_Graph.md`, `How_It_Works/2B_Neural_Plasticity.md`, `How_It_Works/5D_Scaling_Strategy.md`.

## 2. Justification for Novelty & Prior Art Analysis

*   **Prior Art:** Standard graph theory metrics, existing FUM metrics.
*   **Insufficiency:** Standard metrics don't capture multi-scale topology. Existing FUM metrics are heuristic/activity-based. TDA is not mentioned as currently used in FUM docs.
*   **Novelty:** Applying TDA (persistent homology) to FUM's dynamic, emergent KG; quantitatively linking TDA metrics to FUM's internal scores (`efficiency_score`, `pathology_score`); evaluating computational feasibility at relevant FUM scales (e.g., 1M neurons).

## 3. Mathematical Formalism

*   **Hypotheses:**
    *   **H1:** Increased total persistence of 1-dimensional cycles (B1 features) correlates negatively (|r| > 0.6) with `efficiency_score`.
    *   **H2:** Higher count of persistent 0-dimensional components (B0 features) correlates positively (|r| > 0.6) with `pathology_score`.
*   **Input Data:** FUM KG snapshots (`w_ij` sparse tensor) and corresponding `efficiency_score`, `pathology_score` scalars at time `t`.
*   **Algorithms:**
    1.  **Graph Extraction:** Create unweighted, undirected graph `G_t` from `w_ij` by thresholding `abs(w_ij)` at `threshold_w` (e.g., 0.1). Use largest connected component if disconnected.
    2.  **Distance Matrix:** Compute all-pairs shortest paths distance matrix `D_t` on `G_t` (using `networkx.floyd_warshall_numpy`). Handle `inf` distances. *Note: High computational cost O(N^3)/memory O(N^2) bottleneck.*
    3.  **Persistence Calculation:** Compute persistent homology up to `maxdim=2` on `D_t` using `ripser` (Vietoris-Rips filtration). Output diagrams `PD_0`, `PD_1`, `PD_2`.
    4.  **Metric Calculation:**
        *   `M1_t = sum(death - birth)` for pairs in `PD_1`.
        *   `M2_t = count(pairs in PD_0 where death == infinity)`.
    5.  **Correlation Analysis:** Compute Pearson correlation and p-value for `{M1_t}` vs. `{efficiency_t}` and `{M2_t}` vs. `{pathology_t}`.
*   **Implementation:** Python script `_FUM_Training/scripts/analyze_kg_topology.py` using `numpy`, `scipy`, `networkx`, `ripser`.

## 4. Assumptions & Intended Domain

*   Assumes KG snapshots and scores are available/generatable.
*   Assumes Vietoris-Rips filtration on unweighted, thresholded graph captures relevant topology.
*   Assumes threshold `threshold_w` can be appropriately chosen.
*   Assumes M2 definition (count of infinite B0 features) is a meaningful proxy for fragmentation related to pathology.
*   Intended domain: Offline analysis of FUM KG structural evolution.

## 5. Autonomous Derivation / Analysis Log (Summary)

*   **Phase 1:** Defined problem (KG TDA), gathered context (KG structure, metrics, scale, plasticity), refined goal (correlate TDA M1/M2 vs efficiency/pathology, |r|>0.6, assess 1M neuron feasibility), confirmed novelty.
*   **Phase 2:** Generated hypotheses H1 (B1 vs. efficiency), H2 (B0 vs. pathology). Filtered to prioritize H1, H2.
*   **Phase 3:** Formalized algorithms for graph extraction, distance matrix, persistence calculation, metric definition (M1, M2), and correlation analysis. Implemented in Python script `analyze_kg_topology.py`. Acknowledged computational bottlenecks.
*   **Phase 4:** Plausibility checks passed. Attempted empirical validation by executing `_FUM_Training/scripts/analyze_kg_topology.py`. Execution failed as required input data (KG snapshots matching `../data/kg_snapshots/snapshot_*.pkl`) was not found. **Validation Decision: FAILED (Missing Data).**
*   **Phase 5:** Documentation generation initiated.

## 6. Hierarchical Empirical Validation Results & Analysis (Failed)

*   **Plausibility Checks:** Passed.
*   **Test Design:** The script `analyze_kg_topology.py` was designed to run TDA on KG snapshots and perform correlation analysis.
*   **Execution Attempt:** The script was executed after installing the `ripser` dependency.
*   **Failure Mode:** The script terminated because no snapshot files matching the pattern `snapshot_*.pkl` were found in the expected directory `_FUM_Training/data/kg_snapshots/`.
*   **Quantitative Results:** None obtained due to missing data.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Not performed.
*   **Complexity/Resource Estimates:** Script execution was fast due to no data processing. However, previous analysis indicated TDA, particularly distance matrix calculation, is computationally expensive and memory-intensive, posing a challenge for large graphs.

## 7. FUM Integration Assessment

*   Offline analysis tool. No direct FUM integration needed.
*   Provides quantitative structural metrics complementary to existing ones.
*   High computational cost limits real-time use.

## 8. Limitations Regarding Formal Verification

*   Relies on empirical correlation, not formal proof.
*   **Validation Failure:** Empirical validation could not be completed due to the absence of required KG snapshot data.
*   Depends on correctness of TDA libraries (`ripser`).

## 9. Limitations & Future Work

*   **Data Requirement:** The primary limitation is the lack of available KG snapshot data for validation. This data needs to be generated or located.
*   **Computational Cost:** Assuming data becomes available, the high computational cost of the current TDA implementation (especially distance matrix calculation) remains a major bottleneck. Future work should investigate:
    *   More efficient TDA libraries/algorithms (e.g., `Gudhi`, subsampling methods, sparse Rips implementations if available).
    *   Alternative graph representations (e.g., weighted Rips).
    *   Hardware acceleration (GPU-accelerated TDA libraries).
*   **Metric Refinement:** Explore alternative definitions for M2 (Persistent B0 Count) and investigate B2 features. Test sensitivity to `threshold_w`.
*   **Interpretation:** Further work needed to deeply interpret the functional meaning of specific topological features (cycles, voids) in the context of FUM's computation.
*   **Predictive Power:** Investigate if TDA metrics can predict future FUM behavior or performance.
