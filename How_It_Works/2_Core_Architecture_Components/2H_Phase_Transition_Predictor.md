### 2H. Phase Transition Predictor

#### 2H.1 Purpose: Anticipating Critical Shifts at Scale

While the Scaling Dynamics Model (Sec 2.G) aims to predict gradual changes in stability and performance, complex systems like FUM can also undergo abrupt **phase transitions** at certain critical thresholds (e.g., in connectivity density, average firing rate, or plasticity rates). These transitions can lead to sudden, unexpected shifts in network behavior, potentially causing instability or performance degradation if not anticipated.

#### 2H.2 Mechanism: Bifurcation Analysis

To address the risk of unforeseen phase transitions, FUM employs a **Phase Transition Predictor**. This component extends the Scaling Dynamics Model by using techniques from **bifurcation analysis**. Bifurcation analysis mathematically identifies critical points in the parameter space of a dynamical system where the qualitative behavior of the system changes dramatically.

By analyzing the equations of the Scaling Dynamics Model, the Phase Transition Predictor seeks to identify potential bifurcation points related to key FUM parameters, such as:
*   Global connectivity density
*   Balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I ratio)
*   Learning rates for STDP (Sec 2.B)
*   Strength of SIE feedback components (Sec 2.C)
*   Rates of structural plasticity (Sec 4.C)

#### 2H.3 Validation and Application

*   **Predictive Accuracy:** The model's ability to predict critical thresholds is validated by comparing its predictions against empirical observations during the phased validation roadmap (Sec 6.A.7), particularly when scaling between large increments (e.g., 1B to 10B neurons). The target is high accuracy (e.g., >95%) in predicting the parameter values where significant behavioral shifts occur.
*   **Proactive Mitigation:** By identifying potential phase transitions in advance, the Phase Transition Predictor allows for proactive adjustments to FUM's parameters or control mechanisms to either avoid undesirable transitions or to safely navigate through them. This provides an essential layer of safety and predictability when scaling FUM to very large sizes (e.g., 32B+ neurons).
*   **Integration:** Findings and predictions from this model are integrated into the ongoing stability analysis (See Sec 2.E [Placeholder/To be created or updated]) and inform the scaling strategy (Sec 5.D).
