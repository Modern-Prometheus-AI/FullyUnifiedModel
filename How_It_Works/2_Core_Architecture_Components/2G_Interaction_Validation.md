### G. Validation of Mechanism Interactions

#### G.1 Challenge: Complexity and Unintended Interactions

##### G.1.i.
*   FUM integrates multiple complex, adaptive mechanisms (LIF neurons, STDP with variability, SIE with multiple components, structural plasticity, adaptive clustering, etc.). Enhancements designed to address specific limitations (e.g., dynamic STDP timing - Sec 2.B.4, SIE regularization - Sec 2.C.2) further increase this complexity.
*   A critical challenge is ensuring these mechanisms interact synergistically and do not produce unintended negative consequences or new failure modes, especially as the system scales. The feedback loops between SIE, STDP, and structural plasticity, for example, require careful validation.

#### G.2 Multi-Phase Interaction Analysis Strategy

##### G.2.i.
*   To rigorously validate these interactions, a multi-phase analysis strategy is employed:
    *   **Phase 1 (1M Neurons - Isolated Enhancement Testing):** During Phase 1 scaling (Section 5.A), new enhancements (e.g., dynamic STDP timing, SIE regularization) are tested in isolation first. Simulations on 1M neurons measure the impact of each individual enhancement on key performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, convergence speed) and stability (e.g., firing rate variance, STDP weight stability). The target is to ensure each enhancement functions as intended without destabilizing the system (e.g., targeting **95% convergence rate** for each isolated enhancement).
    *   **Phase 2 (10M Neurons - Combined Enhancement Testing & Control Theory):** During Phase 2 scaling (Section 5.B), all enhancements are integrated. Simulations focus on validating the combined effects. Control theory principles are applied to analyze the stability of key feedback loops (e.g., SIE-STDP, plasticity-SIE). The goal is to identify and mitigate potential oscillations, race conditions, or conflicting signals arising from the interactions. The target is to achieve a **90% interaction stability rate** across diverse simulation conditions.
    *   **Continuous Monitoring (All Phases):** Throughout all scaling phases, interaction effects are continuously monitored using targeted metrics (e.g., correlation between SIE novelty signals and structural plasticity rates, impact of STDP timing adjustments on SIE TD-error).

#### G.3 Reporting

##### G.3.i.
*   The methodology and results of this multi-phase interaction analysis, including stability assessments and validation metrics, will be detailed in this section (Section 2.G) upon completion of the relevant simulation phases. This ensures that the complex interplay between FUM's core mechanisms and enhancements is transparently and rigorously validated.
