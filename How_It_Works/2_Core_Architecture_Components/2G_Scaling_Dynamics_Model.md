### 2G. Scaling Dynamics Model

#### 2G.1 Purpose: Predicting Stability at Scale

A significant challenge in developing large-scale neural systems like FUM is predicting how stability and performance metrics will evolve as the network size increases towards the target (e.g., 32B+ neurons). Simple extrapolation from smaller scales (e.g., 1M neurons) can be unreliable due to the potential for non-linear interactions and phase transitions in complex systems.

#### 2G.2 Mechanism: Dynamical Systems Analysis

To address this, FUM incorporates a **Scaling Dynamics Model**. This model utilizes principles from **dynamical systems theory** to analyze the complex feedback loops inherent in FUM's architecture, particularly the interactions between:
*   Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) (Sec 2.B)
*   The Self-Improvement Engine (SIE) (Sec 2.C)
*   Structural Plasticity mechanisms (Sec 4.C)
*   Homeostatic regulation (Sec 2.A.6, 2.B.7)

By modeling these interactions mathematically (e.g., using coupled differential equations representing average cluster activity, synaptic weights, and plasticity rates), the Scaling Dynamics Model aims to predict key stability and performance metrics (e.g., firing rate variance, convergence rates, computational efficiency) as the network scales.

#### 2G.3 Validation and Application

*   **Predictive Accuracy:** The model is validated against empirical results obtained at intermediate scales (e.g., 1M, 10M, 1B neurons) during the phased validation roadmap (Sec 6.A.7). The target is to achieve high predictive accuracy (e.g., >90%) for stability metrics at the next scale increment.
*   **Guiding Development:** The predictions from the Scaling Dynamics Model help anticipate potential scaling bottlenecks or instabilities, allowing for proactive adjustments to FUM's parameters or control mechanisms before reaching full scale. This provides a more rigorous approach to managing complexity and ensuring stability during development.
*   **Integration:** Findings and predictions from this model are integrated into the ongoing stability analysis (See Sec 2.E [Placeholder/To be created or updated]).
