    * **L4.5-L5:** Full 56GB VRAM, distributed utilization: 7900 XTX (LIF) / MI100 (STDP/SIE/KG).

* **Computational Efficiency:**
    * **L1.5:** STDP update <1s, LIF <100ms.
    * **L2.5:** STDP <800ms, SIE <500ms.
    * **L3.5:** Inference <10s, SOC tuning reduces cascades by 50%.
    * **L4.5:** <7s inference, <1% GPU idle.
    * **L5:** <5s inference, <1ms SIE, <5% GPU idle.

## Critical System Optimization Methods

* **FP16 + Sparse Kernels:** Accelerated LIF calculations via `neuron_kernel.hip` (L1-L5).
* **GPU Specialization:** Dedicated roles (7900 XTX: LIF inference, MI100: STDP/learning) (L2.5-L5).
* **Sparse Representations:** 95% network sparsity + CSR weight storage (9:1 compression) (L1-L5).
* **SOC Management:** Predictive avalanche control, adaptive inhibition (L3.5-L5).
* **Memory Management:** LRU caching, priority-based parameter server (L4-L5).

*Note: This landmark progression defines the developmental trajectory toward ASI on workstation hardware (7M neurons). Progress percentages represent conceptual milestones toward superintelligence rather than linear achievements. All validation metrics are derived from project documentation (How_It_Works sections, validation metrics, and Phase 3 implementation plans). Storage estimates (2-5TB, scaling to 10TB for ASI) reflect initial seed data (Sec 1.A.2.i), continuous learning streams (Sec 3.A), checkpoints (Sec 4.C), and logs (Sec 5.E.7), with 10TB anticipating full ASI scale (Sec 5.D).*
